# Feature Selection

In this section, feature selection is implemented to reduce the dimension of the data and to select the most relevant features for building ML models. The data are loaded into Weka, and two columns are deleted involving patient_id, hadm_id. In addition, convert the columns of gender, marital_status, race, congestive_heart_failure, peripheral_vascular_disease, cerebrovascular_disease, dementia, chronic_pulmonary_disease, rheumatic_disease, peptic_ulcer_disease, mild_liver_disease, diabetes_without_cc, diabetes_with_cc, paraplegia, renal_disease, malignan_cancer, severe_liver_disease, metastatic_solid_tumor, aids, admission_type from numerical to nominal values, and keep the remaining columns as numerical types.
 
Two feature selection methods have been checked. Figure 3(a) shows the results of Gain Ratio Attribute Evaluator, and Figure 3(b) indicates the results of Information Gain Attribute Evaluator.  Given the results of feature ranking, four columns (diabetes_with_cc, diabetes_without_cc, aids, rheumatic_disease) are dropped, which is consistent with the results from data exploration.
