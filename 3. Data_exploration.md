# Data Exploration
Prior to initiating the modeling process, data exploration is employed to grasp the attributes, patterns, and interconnections among these data columns, which can help validate the model's predictions, uncover unexpected insights, and guide further decision-making or research. Work in this section is implemented using R. 

## Dependent variables
The dataset comprises 9,703 patients, with 7,766 having survived and 1,937 having died within 90 days after an AMI event. Figure 1 (a) indicates that the dataset exhibits an imbalanced distribution.

## Patient Demographics
### Age and Gender
The average age of patients with AMI who passed away within 90 days is 77, compared to an average age of 70 for those who survived. Among these patients, there are 3,760 females and 5,943 males. Within this group, 29.8% of females and 22.1% of males passed away within 90 days. These findings suggest that older individuals experienced a higher mortality rate. Overall, although more males experienced AMI, females exhibited higher mortality rates than males during the subsequent 90-day period. Moreover, the Figure 1 (b) indicates that prior to the age of 75, the survival rates for both male and female AMI patients follow a similar trend. However, once individuals surpass the age of 75, the survival rate notably decreases in males.

### Marital Status
These patients are categorized into five marital status groups: divorced (7%), married (48.3%), single (20.6%), unknown (7.5%), and widowed (16.4%). Remarkably, the "unknown" group exhibits the highest mortality rate at 30.3%, followed by the widowed group at 27.4%, while the other groups remain below 20%. Consequently, special attention should be directed towards widowed patients. Figure 1 (c) depicts the varying distributions of patients, both living and deceased, across different marital statuses.

### Race
Patients are grouped into five categories based on race: Asian (2.25%), Black/African American (9.36%), Hispanic/Latino (2.96%), White/European (69.2%), and Other/Multiple (16.2%). Interestingly, the mortality rates for all five groups hover around 20%. However, due to potential data bias related to race, the relationship between race and mortality cannot be identified.

### Comorbidities 
Among the 9703 patients with AMI, 16 distinct comorbidities are being considered. The Figure 2 shows that over half of these patients also experience congestive heart failure. However, this particular condition does not notably influence the 90-day mortality rate. On the other hand, comorbidities such as metastatic solid tumors and severe liver disease are strongly correlated with a substantial increase in mortality, exceeding 40%.
