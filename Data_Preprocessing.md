# Data Preprocessing

As mentioned above, only patients with AMI are studied in this project. Thus, the corresponding operation is to search the entire dataset, select the wanted patient samples and choose the input variables. Five steps are included in the data preprocessing to establish a sub-dataset for ML. The SQL codes for the five steps are attached in a separate file together with this report.
