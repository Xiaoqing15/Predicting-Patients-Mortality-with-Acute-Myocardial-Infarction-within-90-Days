# Conclusion

In this project, prediction of patients’ mortality with AMI within 90 days of hospitalization is studied based on ML and MIMIC-IV dataset. Data preprocessing like cleaning and filtering, and feature selection are implemented to prepare the data for ML. The established dataset includes 9703 patients and 36 feature variables. Five ML algorithms – Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Bayes Net and KNN, are employed to build the predictive models, respectively. Generally, the five ML models show good performance in predicting patients’ mortality based on the established dataset for patients with AMI. Among the three models, Bayes Net (Hill-Climber) delivers the best performance in terms of the area under the ROC curve (0.961) and Recall (0.944). In the context of predicting patient mortality, achieving a higher Recall holds significant importance. This ensures the precise identification of patients who are at a heightened risk of mortality. Neglecting such instances might result in delayed interventions and exacerbated outcomes. 

Some limitations of the current work should be noted. First, the developed models have not been validated on an external dataset. Second, there is still much room for improvement in terms of the prediction performance.
Accordingly in the future, the developed ML pipelines will be further evaluated on an external dataset, especially new data collected from different medical sources. Moreover, other ML algorithms, such as neural networks, will be considered to see if further improvement in prediction accuracy could be achieved.
